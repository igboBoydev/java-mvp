Annotations
1. SpringApplication: This is a combination of three different annotations namely: Configuration, ComponentScan, EnableAutoConfiguration
  a. EnableAutoConfiguration: This automatically configures the spring boot application based on the jar dependency that we have added in our pom.xml
  b. ComponentScan: This helps you scan your bean so it can be accessible throughout the codebase.
  c: Configuration: We use this for java based configurations where we can differentiate the bean definition inside a class so that spring ioc can load it
